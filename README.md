# Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone_1

This is a Capstone project, completed as a part of the Google Data Analytics Certification. Here, I have analyzed the ride trends in the customer's behaviour of Cyclistic Bike Share, a fictional company, using R and RStudio Desktop. Seeing the large size of the individual datasets, working on Spreadsheets for initial cleaning was not possible and hence, I opted for RStudio Desktop. Using RStudio Desktop, I was able to perform cleaning operations and manipulations alongwith creating vizualisations on a single platform.



## Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

With a growing fleet of 5824 bicycles along with 692 docking stations, the fictional bike-share company was founded in 2016, and has a wide user base, grouped as:

-   Casual : customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes
-   Members : customers who purchase annual memberships

## Objectives

As per Cyclistic's finance analysts, three questions will guide the future marketing programs:

1.  How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2.  Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3.  How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Preparing Data

The data is stored on AWS cloud and is named correctly and easily downloadable. For this project, I have used data from the year 2021.

Once downloaded, the data is extracted from the ZIP files and stored locally for further analysis on RStudio Desktop. As the data is large, neither spreadsheets nor RStudio Cloud were operable.

Furthermore, the downloaded data is reliable, original, comprehensive, current and is cited by the company.

### Processing Data

Before starting with the analysis, the data needs to be in an orderly manner. In this step, the monthly data is integrated, followed by deleting the NA values, and then inserting a few calculated fields in the original, integrated data frame.

This file with the R code can be found in the repository, named as [GDAC_Cyclistic.r](https://github.com/a-ujjwal/Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone_1/blob/main/GDAC_Cyclistic.r) .
